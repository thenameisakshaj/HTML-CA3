Meddbus Medical Services is a responsive web application
 developed as part of the Continuous Assessment 3 (CA3)
 for the HTML course (CSE326). The application aims to
 provide accessible medical services within a 20 km radius,
 with features including a Terms and Conditions page that
 details user responsibilities, data privacy, and service
 limitations to enhance transparency and trust. A
 Registration Form allows users to efficiently register with
 essential information, streamlining their access to
 Meddbus services. Constructed using HTML and CSS, this
 project underscores fundamental principles of CSE326,
 such as effective structuring and responsive design,
 delivering a user-friendly, visually appealing interface
 compatible across multiple devices. Meddbus is designed
 to support users of varied technical backgrounds,
 bridging healthcare access gaps through an easily
 navigable platform. This project demonstrates the
 application of HTML and CSS in developing practical
 digital solutions to real-world challenges in healthcare
 accessibility
